<!-- <pattern> defines a matching pattern, or part of a matching pattern. Any
     rule nested in a pattern element prepends its parent's to its pattern.
     Patterns may be recursively nested.
     Example:
       <pattern value="foo">
          <pattern value="bar">
            <object-create-rule pattern="baz" classname="Fubar" />
          </pattern>
       </pattern>

     The above sample fragment defines an ObjectCreateRule associated
     with the pattern "foo/bar/baz".

  Note that the use of pattern elements is optional; an alternative is for
  each rule element to contain a 'pattern' attribute.   -->

  <include> allows one set of digester rules to be included inside
  another. The 'path' attribute contains the URI of the document to
  include. Inclusion behaves as if the included rules document is
  'macro-expanded' within the outer document.
  Programmatically initialized rules can be included as well, via the
  'class' attribute. The 'class' attribute should contain the name
  of a class that implements
  org.apache.commons.digester.xmlrules.DigesterRulesSource.
